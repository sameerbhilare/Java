 * These are two different ways to use inter-thread communication to achieve the same goal.
 *
 * SomeClass1 is using the instance of the class as the lock as well as the condition variable.
 *
 * SomeClass2 is using an explicit ReentrantLock as the lock and the Condition object as the condition variable.
 * Using a ReentrantLock and the Condition allows more flexibility as the Condition class has methods like
 * <code>awaitUninterruptibly()</code> and <code>awaitUntil(Date deadline)</code> which the class Object does not have.
 * However, it is more verbose.
